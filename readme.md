# Learning Java Bingo Board
## Summary
This is a learning repo where I create an api that generates unique bingo boards. 
Later it will include a game api where the same numbers used for the bingo board will be called and a winner can be established.

Bingo rules:
- One free square in the middle
- Each letter can only have 15 possible numbers.
  - B - [1 - 15], I - [16 - 30], N - [31 - 45], G - [46 - 60], O - [61 - 75]
- Your card is a winning card if 5 of your numbers are called and in a row. Diagonals included.
